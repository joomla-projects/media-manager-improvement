	 * Rijndael-192 and Rijndael-256 algorithms with different block sizes. These are NOT used in AES. OpenSSL, however,
	 * implements AES correctly. It always uses a 128-bit (16 byte) block. The 192 and 256 bit strengths refer to the
	 * key size, not the block size. Therefore using different strengths in MCrypt and OpenSSL will result in different
	 * and incompatible ciphertexts.
	 *
	 * TL;DR: Always use $strength = 128!
